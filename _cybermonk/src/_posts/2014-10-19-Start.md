### Start with generating ART with code
I always wanted to make art with code. 
So I think the first thing you need to do is start building your library of code.
This blog is a registration of this process.

Not everything will be art, or even pritty... But it will help me towards my goal.

### Haxe
I will be using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) for this.
Perhaps I will share my svg-library eventually (currenly is very WIP )

This blog is also generated with Haxe: [CyberMonk](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/cybermonk) (which is another project that I started)
