I believe that coping from others is a good way to learn, but you should never neglect to mention who provided you with the idea!.
So here we go: this pattern is based on a picture from [Matt(H)Booth](http://matthbooth.com/) and I hope I don't piss him off because he is an bad ass! I don't think this image is an end product for him (check on instagram)[http://instagram.com/p/tU-xDky63j/?modal=true].
But I had fun reproducing it in code.
